[Zibbet](http://www.zibbet.com) is an online handmade artisan marketplace. Basically, you buy and sell handmade goods there. I'm responsible for a sizable chunk of the website and infrastructure it's based on, so **it's quite important to me!**

Our main competitors are Artfire and Etsy who also fill the same target of customers. For now, Zibbet is still growing and has a much smaller userbase than either of those two venues. So that's where you come in ;)

We have been [nominated for best handmade market place](http://diyfashion.about.com/b/2011/02/11/2011-about-com-readers-choice-awards-diy-fashion-finalists-vote-now.htm) \- an honour in itself! Now, we want to **win** [best handmade marketplace](http://diyfashion.about.com/b/2011/02/11/2011-about-com-readers-choice-awards-diy-fashion-finalists-vote-now.htm)!

If we can beat out Artfire and Etsy with our smaller numbers, then it truly means Zibbet is better as a _much_ higher percentage of our users are voting for us!

Every [vote](http://diyfashion.about.com/b/2011/02/11/2011-about-com-readers-choice-awards-diy-fashion-finalists-vote-now.htm) counts, and yours is as important as everyone else's, so please head over to [About.com's Poll](http://diyfashion.about.com/b/2011/02/11/2011-about-com-readers-choice-awards-diy-fashion-finalists-vote-now.htm), select "Zibbet", then hit Submit!
