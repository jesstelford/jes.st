Vim is my preferred editor for programming. However, it has been suggested that other more "full-featured" IDE's are suitable for use with Play as it is a Java framework.

To them I say: "Nerr", and stick out my tongue.

Let's get started setting up Vim for use with the Play Framework.

First up, [install Vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php). (If you had to do that step, then I also suggest [Learning Vim](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/597077/is-learning-vim-worth-the-effort))

Next, [install the SnipMate Vim plugin](//2011/textmate-snippets-vim-snipmate-0) which will help alot when actually programming (this isn't strictly required for using Play, but it is worth the 5 minutes it takes).
